# Simon-Game

## History
Simon, the electronic game of memory, was originally invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison in the late 1970's. It was first publicly played at Studio 54 in New Your City and soon spread around the world, becoming an iconic game throughtout the 80's. 

## Tech Used
I employed several technologies to buld this game: HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. My focus was to write my code with a Model-View-Controller software architectural pattern. By employing this "data-driven" approach I was able to more easily test the applicaton's logic as I went along.
