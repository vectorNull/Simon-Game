# Simon-Game

## History
Simon, the electronic game of memory, was originally invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison in the late 1970's. It was first publicly played at Studio 54 in New Your City and soon spread around the world, becoming an iconic game throughtout the 80's. 

## Tech Used
I employed several technologies to buld this game: HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Javascript. My focus was to write my code with a Model-View-Controller software architectural pattern. By employing this "data-driven" approach I was able to more easily test the applicaton's logic as I went along. It also increased readability and my ability to debug issues as they came up. 

## Next Steps
 - Add difficulty levels
 - Animate colors while going through the sequence of choices
 - Change sounds and use different images for pads to reflect different themes (animals, planets, etc.)
 - Increase the number of pads for greater difficulty
 - Increase speed of pad sequence for greater difficulty
 - display top players

## Instructions
Click on **start** to begin. The computer will begin a random sequence with a corresponding tone. The goal is to mimic the sequence. When the game ends you will see a message that says **game over**. Press **reset* to try again.
